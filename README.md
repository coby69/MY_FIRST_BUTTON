LICENSE INFO:
As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I'm not aware of any license named "Common Grounds License v1.0 Universal." It's possible that this license may have been created or gained prominence after my last update, or it could be a specific license associated with a particular project or organization.

When dealing with software licenses, it's important to review the terms and conditions of the license directly from the official source. If the "Common Grounds License v1.0 Universal" exists, you should be able to find it on the project's or organization's official website, in the project repository, or in the documentation provided with the software.

If you have access to the license text, carefully read and understand its terms to ensure compliance with its requirements. Additionally, consider consulting legal advice if you have specific concerns or questions about the licensing terms and how they apply to your use of the software.
